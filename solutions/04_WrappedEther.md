## CHALLENGE

Native Ether can be difficult to handle sometimes, especially for protocols that deal with other tokens simultaneously. We have developed an ERC-20 variant of Ether called Wrapped Ether. We are aware that there is already a popular version of this concept deployed as WETH9, but would we really be software engineers if we didn't reinvent the wheel? Since development has concluded, you have been tasked with analyzing the contract for potential security issues.


## WINNING CONDITION

Drain the contract of its funds.


## SOLUTION

The contrat doesn't follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern in the `withdrawAll()` function and so is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

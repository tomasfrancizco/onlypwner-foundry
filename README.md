# Onlypwner Solutions

This project is structured around the [onlypwner](https://onlypwner.xyz/) challenges in the following way

`/src`: the challenge's source code.
`/script`: the scripts that solve each challenge.
`/test`: tests that were done, if any.
`/solutions`: an explanation of each challenge, the winning condition and solution.

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to update the `.env` file with the necessary data for each challenge.

## Solving Challenges

To solve a challenge, you'll need to run the corresponding `solve_xx` command from the Makefile. For example, to solve the first challenge, you would run:

```bash
make solve_00
